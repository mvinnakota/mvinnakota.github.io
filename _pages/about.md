I am an environmental economist using applied microeconomics methods to better understand how households, firms, and governments insure themselves against natural disaster risks. I currently hold a position as an Economic Fellow at the Institute for Policy Integrity at NYU Law School, where I focus on climate risk and resilience topics. 

I received my doctorate in June 2024 from the Harris School of Public Policy at the University of Chicago. My dissertation research focused on the economics of natural disasters, quantifying the economic impacts of hurricane exposure and studying the interactions between various flood policy instruments.
